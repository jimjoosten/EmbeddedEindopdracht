# Embedded eindopdracht

This is a final assignment I am making with Jesper. C-University, in collaboration with Astrum College, has created a PCB that allows students to practice programming a microcontroller in conjunction with the C programming language.

The assignment was that you could come up with your own project so we came up with the following:

We make an alarm system where through a magnetic connection (door) can be detected whether the door is closed or open. On a led strip the code (no numbers but a color code) can be set. You can enter the code using the rotary meter. If the alarm is on it will go off after 1 minute if the magnetic connection is broken. Unless you have entered the correct color code within that minute. Also if you have entered the wrong code 3 times the alarm will go off. The alarm can be set up simply by clicking on the rotary confirm by entering your color code again and close the door (magnet).
